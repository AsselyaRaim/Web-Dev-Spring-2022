        <h1>Choices</h1>
        <p>
            I go to the mountain side<br>
            of the house to cut saplings,<br>
            and clear a view to snow<br>
            on the mountain. But when I look up,<br>
            saw in hand, I see a nest clutched in<br>
            the uppermost branches.<br>
            I don’t cut that one.<br>
            I don’t cut the others either.<br>
            Suddenly, in every tree,   <br>
            an unseen nest<br>
            where a mountain<br>
            would be.
